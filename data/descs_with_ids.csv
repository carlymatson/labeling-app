I walked over and talked to the operations manager for the carpet cleaners who indicated that they perform the service 3 times a year, and must do it overnight because of all the foot traffic during the day. He also indicated that they would be running the equipment on and off until approximately 5am. While I appreciate the need for the service, and the timing may be exactly appropriate, the equipment is quite noisy, and I believe it violates ordinances. The operations manager did not indicate that they have a variance/waiver for the noise ordinance, and didn't believe they were in violation of any codes. One other note, that may not be relevant: they appear to be dumping dirty water from the carpet cleaning process into the storm sewers for the shopping center.

I work nights and would appreciate if I wasn't rudely awakened every hour and half-hour.  Please I invite you to hang out at my apartment for a day and see for yourself.

192774,KCMO-2010306251,"Citizen states: I am a resident of Library Lofts, located at the corner of 10th and Baltimore.  This is an entire block down from John's Upper Deck.  Most nights, the noise from the rooftop bar is not an issue.  I live downtown and expect there to be noise.  Usually it is just background noise and nothing that turning up the volume on my TV can't cover up.  However, the past few weeks, it has gotten completely out of hand.  Sunday nights there is karaoke until 3am.  It's not background noise.  I can hear, word for word, what songs are being sung.  I can hear exactly what the DJ is saying into the microphone.  This has kept me up every Sunday for the past three weeks until 3am.  Other residents have been complaining as well.  One woman told me she contacted the local police and was told there was nothing they could do about it.  That since the business has a permit to operate until 3am, they are legally allowed to make as much noise as they want.  I have read Chapter 46 of the Noise Control Code and don't see how this is possible.  There are multiple residental loft buildings in the proximity of this bar.  Many of the residents I have spoken with about the excessive noise have already voiced that once their lease is up, they are moving out of the city because of their complaints constantly going unheard. I have resorted to taking sleeping pills so that I can fall asleep no matter how loud the music is, however, tonight I was woken up by the noise of a live band on the rooftop bar at 2am.  The residents of Kansas City, MO deserve to have a full nights sleep.  We're not complaining about Friday and Saturday nights, when we expect it to be loud.  But during the week, is there not a time that outside bars need to lower their volume?  If we are living a block a way and have our windows closed, being woken up by drunken karaoke singers should just be something we have to accept?

These trucks are operating form early morning to late evening, everyday.  Many times the drivers will use engine breaking which is so loud it literally shakes the ground.  The noise they are making has made it impossible for the families that live along this route to use their backyards and decks that face the road.  Not only is it so loud that we can't hear one another when outside, it is also preventing us from opening our windows due to the excessive noise which in turn causes much higher electric bills than necessary.

The bands were amplified so loud, that while out driving I could clearly hear the bands as far south as Childrens Mercy Hospital, and as far west as 17th and Summit. Please address this extremely excessive noise violation with this music venue. Their shows are already scheduled for all nights of the week, all summer long, and more shows will be added every month. There are as many, or more, permanent residents living in this neighborhood, as there are commercial businesses. Grinders must comply with the existing city noise ordinances. Their entire audience stands in an outside fenced area within a few yards from the stage; so this illegal noise volume is unnecessary and unreasonable. Please abate this serious ongoing problem.

Here is the timeline and description as it stands now at 10:17 pm. For the record I reside at 2947 McGee TRFY to put perspective on the matter.
8:58 PM Music begins extremely loud. An extended Drum event 
9:09 PM Vocals added in, so loud the words can be clearly heard 
9:15 Bass guitars comes in as well 
9:25 PM - 9:42 still quite loud

10:12PM VERY loud announcements are coming across the PA Music switches to DJ (with/ band).
10:20PM and onward - Music is continuing at a very loud and audible level now disturbing my wife's attempt to sleep despite using earplugs I think it is fairly obvious your ' Talk ' had little or no affect with  the proprietors of Magnolia's and their excessively loud  outdoor music.  And for the record Magnolia's has announced another live music event for 6/7/12 which i will file an independent report on assuming it exceeds reasonable sound levels. Now my background as a professional musician includes a degree in Sound Recording and Engineering and I know damn well Magnolia's sound levels are exceeding what is expressed in the City and County code. My neighbor one door east has expressed similar complaints as well. So what is Code Enforcement going to do to defend my CIVIL Right to Peaceable Domicile? I would appreciate both an email as well as a phone call: preferably from someone in charge and with a reasonable amount of authority to take action on this ongoing problem. As reported below in my earlier email Magnolia's @ 2932 Cherry St KCMO did hold a second outdoor live music this weekend on 7/7/12.
Once again: with all windows closed - A/C on constantly (due to the heat)indoor fountain running in an attempt to mask the sound - and TV on at normal volume the sound level of the music coming from the band at Magnolia's was loud enough to be heard above our TV volume and clear enough for myself as a musician to be able to transcribe - Note for Note - each and every one of the bass players lines . And in fact as the evening progressed the volume increased then allowing me to transcribe the keyboard players lines ... again Note for Note Here is the timeline for 7/7/12:

I politely told him I would call the city promptly at 11:00 if the music was not off. The music ended at 11:20pm.

Although the opening act sound level was tolerable there must have been something in the headliner's contract that they were required to be TWICE as loud.

My daughter was happy with her front-row vantage point to see the band but after a few songs I grew more and more concerned that the sound level was completely over the top and out of bounds.  Even at the back of the audience area, it was TOO LOUD.

I have played in rock bands and estimate the volume level to have been in the 120 db level, and wish I had had a decibel meter with me.

It is not an enjoyable experience and what's more it is physical assault on my hearing.

I have attended shows there before that were not nearly so loud.  The only higher volume level for a show I have ever been at was when I had taken my son, then 14, to an Offspring show at the Uptown Theater.

The most recent loud music disturbance was Thursday - 08/09/2012.  The music started at approximately 10am.  The back door to the business was open making the music even louder in the neighborhood.  In addition to the noise disturbances caused by the music being played, the customers were also creating a great deal of noise by very enthusiastically showing their appreciation of the music with yelling and clapping which was easily heard in the neighborhood with the back door being open.

The east windows of SinbadÂ¿s directly overlook Central Street and are within a hundred feet or so of homes.  This business does not have any sound barriers installed so literally any music they play is very easily heard in the neighborhood, with the music being even louder when the back door is left open, which is often the case.

The rear (east) windows of this business directly face the residential neighborhood and are within a few hundred feet of homes.  This business does not have any sound barriers installed so literally any music they play can easily be heard throughout the residential neighborhood directly behind their building.

The parking lot for this business is located behind their building and also directly faces, and is in even closer proximity to, the residential neighborhood.  While this musical event was running, the parking lot was filled with large numbers of noisy people, including many minors, having a very good time which further disturbed the peace and quiet of the residential neighborhood.

265961,Bloomington Mix-26083,"Hi! We live on South Banta Avenue, and because the road is on a hill, and also because it provides a shortcut between Tapp Road and Ralston, we routinely see cars charging up and down the hill as fast as they can go. (Today we watched a truck moving uphill actually pull over to one side and make a complete stop to allow a sedan to shoot downhill past it, still accelerating.) This is terrifying, as we have two young children, one of whom is still under two years old. We routinely bike with the kids in tow, and the most frightening part of our entire journey is the short time we have to bike up or down our own street. There have been two accidents at the corner of Tapp and Banta within the past week, and a neighbor's cat was run over recently as well. I'm not sure what a workable solution would be, whether posted speed limit or children at play signs would effectively change motorist behavior. There are numerous families with children in the neighborhood, and since most of Banta Ave has neither sidewalk nor curb, children trying to move from their homes even to the neighborhood park at the Broadview Learning Center are in considerable danger--this is true throughout much of the Broadview neighborhood area. As for South Banta Avenue, I would love to see a few speed bumps put in. I'd even welcome a few giant potholes. Seriously.  
I hope that the intersection of Tapp and Rockport is scheduled to become a traffic circle in time, which I hope will alleviate this problem eventually. But in the meantime, I would appreciate any feedback as to what might be possible for our street, and if there is anything that we can do.

Best,

He blamed the mishap on a construction storage container blocking his view across the road and that he just didn't see me.  After his three city supervisors arrived before police to investigate and talk to the driver, he told the police that I had hit him.  This is a  team   effort of 6 city employees and myself. The two city police officers said it was just his word against mine and If I took it to court, the judge is not an  accident re constructionist  and it would be just my word and his. He suggested I turn it into my insurance.  Officer Green stated I had insurance, he saw the card.   I have 20 pictures of the accident, including where each party was located and the damage to the rear of my vehicle.  The city of Chattanooga's public servants should be showing leadership and honesty, not providing coaching information to change the facts.   I am requesting that this be investigated by an independent party, since the accident investigator from the police department would not come.  The operator of the garbage truck driver's background should be investigated.

276187,Bloomington Mix-73451,"Hi. After witnessing my third or fourth car accident in the past six months at the exact same intersection (when walking on the sidewalk every time), I would like to request the installation of a traffic light at Longview and Pete Ellis. This intersection, only two minutes from my house, is undeniably dangerous and (I am 99% positive) fatal at least once. The faster traffic on Pete Ellis doesn't have a stop sign, so when cars on Longview turn, it is hard for them to detect those fast vehicles. I have almost been hit crossing the street it is that bad. Today, December 22nd, a friend of mine was seriously hurt in an accident at that intersection.Despite the costs of a traffic light and the work it will entail, I do not want to risk my life and my friends' lives and the lives of other citizens anymore.

His name is Jason Gilchrist, and his dumping was repeatedly witnessed by neighbors.  This debris caused the pipe from Club drive to the golf course to become plugged and back up and completely flood my entire yard and under my house.  You quickly cleared the pipe and brush from upstream, however the issues does not seem to be resolved yet, I'm guessing until the downstream flow is cleared and made adequate for the amount of water entering the Club Drive pipe.  Could you please review this section of above ground ditch and make sure it is lowered, widened, or cleared as necessary to stop the overflows at this location of Tacoa Ave as well as the backup to the storm drain ditch behind 213 Tacoa Ave?  Thank you for your time in addressing this issue.  Regards, Jeanne Fulton  561-504-3778",Stormwater,Flooding

299966,Chattanooga-2545968,"My name is Sonya Anglin and I live at 5413 Tennessee Avenue in St. Elmo, in between 54th and 55th Street. Yesterday, my roommates and I returned home around 5pm in the evening and inside we smelled toxic paint fumes, it appeared to smell like spray paint or epoxy resin. Throughout the whole house. There was no smell outside, only inside the house. We couldn't figure out where it was coming from and opened the windows, turned the A/C off, and eventually evacuated the house. I know I breathed some of the fumes in because I could still smell it hours later while out at dinner and was coughing. My chest feels tight still today and I can't breathe as well and my throat felt like it was burning slightly. We left the house and windows up, and stayed out for about 3 hours and came back and still smelled it strongly. We opened more windows and the front door and called the fire department. They didn't find any gas or flammables or carbon monoxide, but they did say that sewer gas could come up through the pipes into the home. This was not sewer gas. The city has been doing work on Tennessee Avenue the past 2 weeks and working on the manholes/sewer pipes. Have any of these pipes been lined or repaired with epoxy resin?

Just after crossing the bridge over Mountain Creek, there is a very narrow shoulder that drops off into a 4 feet deep drainage ditch. There is no guardrail to prevent a car from going into the drainage ditch. With the consistent rains that Chattanooga has had, the narrow shoulder has dropped about 12 inches below the road.
