Examples 
typos intended to mimic production data

Easier to classify

"Citizen reported a streetlight pole on the southwest side of the ramp from eastbound 150 Hwy to southbound Botts Road is down."

Rationale for label:

This description clearly outlines a streetlight that is down

More difficult to classify

"Trash truck hit a streetlight pole SIH1506 and the wire is down."

Rationale for label:

This description is a little bit more difficult since there is mention of a wire as well. In this particular case we would still want to label this as a Downed Streetlight because remediation of the streetlight complaint will include handling of the wires issue.

D1: Traffic Study
Definition
Description whose central theme is around observations about the current environment and flow of traffic in a location. Typically these are cases that will require the city to come out and make an observation of the environment before taking action to resolve the issue. 

Notes

These can be particularly difficult because the classification of "something that the entity needs to come out and make an observation on before acting" is often based on outside knowledge that the reader may or may not have

Clarifications
Examples of things that would require traffic studies include but are not limited to: 

any situation where speeding is a problem and the caller is requesting new speed limit signs or a change in the speed limit

situations that would require counts of vehicles passing a specific location

installation of new traffic lights or new traffic signs that were previously not in place
