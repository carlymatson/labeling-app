D1: Flooding (LABEL NO LONGER IN USE)
Definition
Description whose central theme is around cases of large amounts of water gathering in a location that can be directly traced back to the water asset at that location

Clarifications
Source is important for this label

If the source of the flooding can be traced back to weather-related causes then the best label pair is most likely Stormwater|Flooding

If the source of the flooding can be traced back to a water asset explicitly then the best label pair is most likely Water|Flooding

If the source of the flooding is not clearly specified then the best label pair is most likely Defer|Flooding

Definition
Description whose central theme is around issues with frozen pipes

Clarifications

typos intended to mimic production data

Easier to classify

"Trying to get pipes unthawed, nothing is working.  Trying to do laundry, son is coming home from hospital and he needs water.  House smells bc toilet can't flush.  Everything she needs to cook needs water. "

More difficult to classify

"The caller is a maintenance person with a tenant who has frozen pipes behind the water meter and needs our tech to come out to un thaw these pipes tonight. Please call him back."

Rationale for label:

This description is a bit more difficult since it also references the water meter but it does specify that the pipes are frozen behind the water meter so we label this as Frozen Pipes

Commonly Confused With
Water|Service Interruption

D1: High Pressure
Definition
Description whose central theme is around the pressure in the water system being above typical levels

Examples 
typos intended to mimic production data

Easier to classify

"Caller says their pipes are hammering because of the high pressure water"

More difficult to classify

"The caller stated her water pressure is at 90 and should be at 80. If her call could be returned to assist."

Rationale for label:

This description is a bit tricky because it does not specifically say that the water pressure is high but it does give numeric values in the description that allow us to see that the pressure is high so we label it as such

Commonly Confused With
Water|Low Pressure

D1: High Usage
Definition
Description whose central theme is around instances where a citizen's water usage is far above normal levels

Clarficiations
Often these descriptions will reference a potential leak. In cases such as these, if the leak is not explicitly occurring then the best label pair is Water|High Usage

D1: Low Pressure
Definition
Description whose central theme is around the pressure in the water system being below typical levels

Examples 
typos intended to mimic production data

Easier to classify

"Citizen is reporting low water pressure in the entire home. Someone will be home."

More difficult to classify

"The caller states the water on the first floor is working on low stream but none of the sinks upstair or showers are working."

Rationale for label:

This description does not explicitly reference a low-pressure problem. It does however indicate that there is an issue with access to water upstairs in the dwelling and that the stream on the first floor is low. From this, we can deduce that this is a low-pressure problem and label it as such

Commonly Confused With
Water|High Pressure

Water|Service Interruption

D1: Meter Issue
Definition
Description whose central theme is around water asset issues occurring at the water meter

Clarifications
This can easily get confused with Water|Water Leaking in instances where the meter itself is leaking

Location of the leak is important here

If the leak is happening at the meter then the best label pair is most likely Water|Meter Issues

If the leak is happening at a location other than the meter then the best label pair is most likely Water|Water Leaking or another Water|* label pair

Instances of frozen water meters are not included here and should be labeled as Water|Frozen Meter

D1: Service Disconnected
Definition
Description whose central theme is around a lack of water service for reasons related to bill payment or lack thereof

Clarifications
Requests for water turn on service that cannot be attributed to a previous request to turn the water off are included in this label

Requests for water turn on service to a new residence are included in this label

Apparent reason for the lack of service is important for this label

If the lack of water is referred to in the context of a billing issue and the water outage is affecting a single residence then the best label pair is most likely Water|Service Disconnected. 

If the lack of water is NOT referred to in the context of a billing issue or if the water outage appears to be affecting many citizens then the best label pair is most likely Water|Service Interruption. 

Examples 
typos intended to mimic production data

Easier to classify

"The caller said he has paid his water bill, caller said no one came to turn on the water, caller said he has an infant that needs water to make formula"

Rationale for label:

This description references a lack of water service in the context of a bill

More difficult to classify

"The caller does not have any water and is unsure why. The water meter is locked and is blank. It has been 2 days."

Rationale for label:

This description is a bit trickier since it also mentions a water meter but does not explicitly reference billing. Luckily we have a clue: when a water meter is locked, service has been intentionally turned off. Due to this, we are able to label it as Service Disconnected

Commonly Confused With
Water|Service Interruption

Water|Billing

D1: Service Interruption
Definition
Description whose central theme is around a lack of the water service for any reason other than lack of bill payment

Clarifications
Apparent reason for the lack of service is important for this label

If the lack of water is referred to in the context of a billing issue and the water outage is affecting a single residence then the best label pair is most likely Water|Service Disconnected.

Rationale for label:

The description references an outage that is affecting an entire building

More difficult to classify

"The caller stated that the main water line broke and she is unable to turn on her water due to no water pressure."

Rationale for label:

This description is tricker since it mentions no water pressure in addition to an outage. Since the outage is the more pressing problem overall and it appears that the outage is not related to billing, we select to label this as Service Interruption

Commonly Confused With
Water|Service Disconnected

D1: Service Request
Definition
Description whose central theme is around work a citizen is asking the city to perform that related to the water asset

Examples 
typos intended to mimic production data

Easier to classify

D1: Shutoff Request
Definition
Description whose central theme is around a citizen requesting temporary or permanent discontinuation of the water asset

Clarifications
This can easily be confused with Water|Water Leaking in cases where the request for turn off is due to a water leak

If a leak is mentioned in the description and there is already a clear plan to remediate a leak or someone is on the premises to begin remediation then the best label pair is most likely Water|Shutoff Request

If a leak is mentioned in the description and there is no indication that there is a remediation plan for the leak then the best label pair is most likely Water|Water Leaking

Examples 
typos intended to mimic production data

Easier to classify

"Needs water turned off at 1005 S Plum St"

More difficult to classify

"The citizen is needing the water shut off to perform repairs inside the house. A technician has been out today to shut the water for repairs, but there is still water flowing to the property.

D1: Turn On Request
Definition
Description whose central theme is around a request to reinstate the water asset service after a period when it has been off by request

Clarifications
The reason for the power being off is important for this label

If the water is off because the citizen previously asked for it to be turned off then the best label pair is most likely Water|Turn On Request

If the water is off for another reason and the citizen is asking for it to be turned back on then the best label pair is most likely one of the following: Water|Service Interruption or Water|Service Disconnected

Examples 
typos intended to mimic production data

Easier to classify

"Contractor is calling to request the water be turned back on at 5906 Grand Ave. as the repairs have been completed."

Rationale for label:

This description is not explicitly saying that the water was purposefully turned off in the past but since it is a contractor making the request, there is enough clear context for us to label this as Water|Turn Of Request

More difficult to classify

"The caller called to close her water today and she now she is requesting to open it up."

Rationale for label:

This description is a little trickier only because of the wording the caller uses. The terms "close" and "open" sound more related to a billing account than a water service but since we are unable to make that decision explicitly we label this as Water|Turn On Request

Commonly Confused With
Water|Service Disconnected
