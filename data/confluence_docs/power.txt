D1: Transformer Issue
Definition
Description whose central theme is around problems with power transformers

Clarifications
Problems can include but are not limited to: transformer explosion, transformer fire, transformer poping, and transformer cycling.

In cases where the transformer problem has caused an outage, we select Transformer Issue because it is the more pressing problem due to danger to citizens. 

Examples
typos intended to mimic production data

Easier to classify

"The Transformer has blown and it's it's at the driveway of 2381 Willis Road, Berea."

More difficult to classify

"With out power. There is a electrical pole across the street has loud explosion with fire coming out when the electricity comes back on then it goes back out again keeps cycleing"

Rationale for label:

This description is more difficult. It references an electric pole and states that an explosion has happened. A pole itself does not explode but the power transformers that are on the pole can. There is a reference to the power being out but the more immediate issue in this description is that there has been an explosion at the location. Because of this, we select the label Power|Transformer Issue

Commonly Confused With
Power|Power Asset Issue
