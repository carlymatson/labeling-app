Easier to classify

"Citizen is calling to report that the driver brake tail light is out on truck number 7183, blue truck with tool boxes on the back."

Reationale for label:

This description references a truck with an associated truck number (indicating this is work truck of some sort for the municipality) and requests maintenance

More difficult to classify

"She is calling with the PD. One of the city vans at the waterworks, the horn is constantly going off."

Rationale for label:

This description clearly indicates that the vehicle belongs to the municipality but does not explictly request maintenance. In this case, addressing the alarm is considered a request for Vehicle Maintenance
