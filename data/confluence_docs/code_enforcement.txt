D1: Abandoned Vehicle
Definition
Description whose central theme is related to vehicles (of any sort) that have been abandoned for a prolonged amount of time in a public location

Clarifications
The location of the vehicle is critical to identifying if this is a Code Enforcement|Abandoned Vehicle description or a Code enforcement|Estate Complaint description.

Vehicles abandoned on public property (streets, parks, etc.) are labeled as Code Enforcement|Abandoned Vehicle while vehicles abandoned on private property are labeled Code enforcement|Estate Complaint.

Examples
typos intended to mimic production data

Easier to classify

"Bike is locked to handicap sign (2wks), forbidding bicycles to be locked to it."

Rationale for label:

The description clearly indicates that a vehicle (the bike) has been left in a public location. We know this is a public location because of the reference to the handicap sign; these signs are typically only present in public locations.

More difficult to classify

"She mentioned there was a van dumped in front of her street, it was done by a group of kids probably teenagers. She is not sure if it was stolen."

Rationale for label:

The description is referencing a van that has been dumped. The term "dumped" is typically associated with abandoning something or throwing it away. What makes this difficult to label is that the description also mentions the possibility that the van was stolen. In this case, the caller is "not sure" so we default to the main reported issue.

D1: Animal Violation
Definition
Description whose central theme is around violations of leash laws, noise ordinances, or welfare rights regarding animals

Clarifications

Examples
typos intended to mimic production data

Easier to classify

"Citizen is calling to request that the dogs living at 4129 Brooklyn Ave be investigated for no being on a leash and for not having tags or licenses. One dog is blackish gray and the other dog is light brown in color both are Pit Bull mix."

Rationale for label:

This description requests an investigation for attributes of the dog's that are clearly the responsibility of a human; putting a dog on a leash, getting it tags, and obtaining the proper licenses for it.

More difficult to classify

"These people have about 10 ferrets running around their house that they can't feed and keep bothering neighbors to help them out with pet food. They also have a really big dog that looks emaciated. They also have a black cat."

Rationale for label:

Commonly Confused With
Defer|Animal Complaint

D1: Construction Complaint
Definition
Description whose central theme is around damage or disturbance to citizens caused by explicit construction and/or land development projects. Projects can be performed by industrial, personal, or municipality actors

Clarifications
These disturbances can include things such as damage to personal property, redirection or blockage of water flows that can be directly attributed to the construction project, and debris obstructing access to personal property

Attribution is very important in this classification.

If the description indicates that the violating party is a construction or development project then the description is likely to be a Code Enforcement|Construction Complaint

If the description indicates that the violating party is someone or something OTHER THAN a construction or development project and the main complaint is about the redirection or blockage of water flows then the description is likely to be a Code Enforcement|Drainage Violation

Examples
typos intended to mimic production data

Easier to classify

"Citizen called in to advise that his yard and everyone elses yards are being flooded when it rains due to the developers behind his residence"

Rational for label:

This description indicates that work done by developers working near the citizens residence is causing a redirection of water flows that is disrupting the citizen and other citizens in the area.

More difficult to classify

"Caller state that her neighbor was making him a driveway and he cut some of the curb down.Caller state this is going to cause flooding and will need to build the curb back up"

Rational for label:

This description is related to the personal construction project of a neighbor. While not damage has resulted to the citizen's property at the time the description is reported, the citizen states that future damage is likely.

"CALLER STATES THAT THE RESIDENT IS DRAINING WATER ONTO HIS PROPERTY, BLOCKING HIS DRAINAGE. PLEASE INSPECT."

Rationale for label:

D1: Estate Complaint
Definition
Description whose central theme is related to complaints about personal property conditions, typically that are violating building codes or property regulations.

Clarifications
These are most often about a neighboring property but are occasionally about the calling citizen's property if they are not the owner of said property

Location is important here. If a reported problem cannot be localized to a citizen's residence and/or property, it will NOT BE labeled as an Estate Complaint

Examples
typos intended to mimic production data

Easier to classify

"This residence has no hot water or hot water tank, large hole in basement wall, no electric service, no working appliances, and is infested with bugs. There are no fire alarms, and no exits which creates a hazard."

Rational for label:

This description refers to a derelict building with conditions that are indicated to be hazardous. The building is clearly identified as a residence

More difficult to classify

"caller is stating that she has mold in her bathroom above the tub. The maintance crew came out on 2/20/07 and cleaned it with bleach/water. She was told that it was from condensation however the mold has returned. She is not getting a reply from management on addressing the problem. Pls investigate. Thanks"

Rational for label:

This description refers to issues in the citizen's own residence but indicates that a maintenance crew is responsible for upkeep. The call is suggesting that the citizen is unable to get the maintenance crew to properly maintain the residence and needs assistance.

More difficult to classify

"There was a man driving a silver Toyota Corolla that looked really suspicious as he got into the neighborhood. He parked his car next to the bushes, lighted a cigarette, walked into the bushes, looked around, came back to his vehicle, opened the trunk, and he took out a trash bag full of glass bottles (I could hear the glasses and the bag seemed very heavy) and took the back into the bushes. He took out another (one or two more trash bags), and did the same thing. He moved them into the bushes, then he drove off."

Rational for label:

This description also clearly references the dumping of trash items in a location that is not a trash receptacle but it also discusses the character of the citizen in question which could lead to a different classification if focused on. However, the main content of the description is the dumping of the trash bags.
