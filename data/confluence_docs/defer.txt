Clarifications
Cause is important for this label. If the wreckage/debris can be traced back to a vehicle accident then the label should most likely be Defer|Accident Cleanup. If the wreckage/debris can NOT be traced back to an accident then it is possible that the label could be Defer|Debris Complaint.
